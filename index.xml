      <description>Vantage Point creates galleries from photo albums and directories. If you gather art and other sources of creative inspiration, Vantage Point provides a great way of viewing these collections without forcing you into a foreign file structure.

 Birds Eye View Vantage Point renders birds-eye-views of your picture collections. Just feed it a folder or album and it goes to work arranging your galleries into a mosaic format that attempts to honor the aspect ratio of the images.</description>
